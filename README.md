Pydrills is a collection of interesting problems inspired by Peter Norvig's pytudes.
I use them to tackle challenges which I regard as useful and in order to gain a deeper understanding of certain concepts.
As such, they can be thought of as sort of an educational tool to allow for a more intuitive approach to a certain group of problems.

I try to do atleast one of them per month, but don't always manage.
